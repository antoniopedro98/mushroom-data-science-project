# Occupancy Estimation Data Science Project

This project was carried out as the final work of the discipline of Software Engineering for Data Science in the Master's program at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro.

The objective was to explore several classification, or regression, models to solve a problem, following good practices for intelligent software development.

In this project, I explore the dataset available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository that estimates the number of people in a room from environmental indicators collected by non-intrusive sensors, such as CO2, light and sound produced.
